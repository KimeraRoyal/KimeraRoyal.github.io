	  <h1 class="center-text">About Me</h1>
	  <img class="image-right" src="images/Photo.png" alt="A photo of me wearing cat ears."></img>
	  <p>After crawling out of an ominous puddle of primordial slime in 2001, I lurched out of my dismal creek and into the world. I eventually picked up a few skills, which I try to use whenever possible.</p>
	  <p>From 2017 until 2020 I studied at Kingston College: in 2018 I earned a Distinction Merit in Game Design, while in 2020 I earned a Distinction* Distinction* Distinction in Music Technology. I'm now in my first year of studying Game Software Engineering at Bournemouth University.</p>
	  <p>I am able to program in a handful of languages such as C, C++, C#, and Java. I can rapidly take on new skills when necessary and fill in gaps of my knowledge on the fly - for example, when homebrewing for the GBA, I taught myself how to use Makefiles to optimize my development pipeline.</p>
	  <p>In my free time, I like to compose music, draw (both digitally and physically), write poetry, and program games. I have lots of dreams for the future: I'd love to work as an audio programmer at some point, working on DAWs and VSTs, and at some point I would love to work with a small team to develop fun, accessible, engaging games that appeal to a wide array of people. I will also continue composing - I might end up going back and doing an undergraduate degree in music at some point. Finally, I would really love to get the qualifications to become a teacher so that I can inspire others to go and chase their dreams as well!</p>
