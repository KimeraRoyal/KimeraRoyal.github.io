    {"id": 0, "name": "Ambient Cutscene", "year": "2018", "description": "Written for a college assignment, this was one of my first ever attempts at making ambient music. It's pretty good."},
    {"id": 1, "name": "Arch Dreamon (Boss)", "year": "2019", "description": "I truly do not believe you can go wrong by starting a song out with a bunch of fast orchestra hits. I played a lot with Logic's ability to bounce a section in place here leading to lots of chops, reverses, etc. It all just ups the otherworldly factor a little."},
    {"id": 2, "year": "Arch Dreamon (Encounter)", "year": "2020", "description": "A big villain encounter theme for the demo of my RPG, Dustworld. This piece was very fun to write - I made a point to do the entire composition in piano, before I did any arranging. The end song flows very well, my favourite parts are definitely the creepy pitch down at 0:49 and the heroic melody at 1:10."},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Burning Forest", "year": "2020", "description": "This is a very cute song. The composition is pretty jazzy, but obviously the arrangement goes in a very different direction. In the future, I would love to flesh this out a bit more."},
    {"id": 4, "name": "Climatic Battle 2", "year": "2018", "description": "A reimagining of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/reddeh-3c/climatic-showdown-updated\" target=\"_blank\">one of the first songs I ever made</a> where I was happy with the end result, improving it by using lots of new techniques I had picked up."},
    {"id": 5, "name": "Cult Grunt Battle", "year": "2018", "description": "This is a fun villain battle theme in a blues scale - it's not particularly intimidating but I don't really think this kind of song has to be. Some good boss themes can cover all the intimidation, while the grunts should be exciting and catchy."},
    {"id": 6, "name": "Cutscene", "year": "2019", "description": "An all-strings piece written for college, this one is very warm - I wonder what kind of scene it would play under? Perhaps a hero departing for a long quest, and saying goodbye to their loved ones?"},
    {"id": 7, "name": "Fantasy Game King (1)", "year": "2019", "description": "This is meant to be a theme that would underscore a dramatic pre-boss monologue for some kind of evil king. In an actual game there would probably be a way friendlier version of this, with him being evil as a plot twist right near the end."},
    {"id": 8, "name": "Fantasy Game King (2)", "year": "2019", "description": "Obviously this is the battle right after that dramatic monologue - I kind of had the idea in my head that, in this hypothetical game, the monologue would happen while you fight the king, and then this is the second phase. There's a very fun and effective use of Kirby bass here, too."},
    {"id": 9, "name": "Forest", "year": "2020", "description": "An example piece of backing music for my typing treasure-hunting RPG, Keysword. Light, sparkly, and adventurous - it really successfully evokes the emotional response I feel like you'd get from setting off into a mysterious forest to hunt for secrets."},
    {"id": 10, "name": "Fortune Teller", "year": "2019", "description": "The first of many pieces of circus-inspired music here - I REALLY like clowns. This is a boss theme for a fictional fantasy game, the same one as the King songs, for a mysterious fortune teller who'd act as some kind of hidden superboss if you try to screw with them."},
    {"id": 11, "name": "Gatewatcher", "year": "2020", "description": "The major boss theme for Dustworld. The Gatewatchers are powerful eldritch monsters who try to stop people from escaping from a dreamscape; check out the Dreamons in my <a href=\"art.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-pause-music=\"false\">Art portfolio</a> for an idea of the type of enemy this song is meant to fit. Strong, scary, imposing, a little unnatural - it's everything that I think a good boss theme should be."},
    {"id": 12, "name": "Generic Battle", "year": "2020", "description": "I was very inspired by 'Cult Grunt Battle' with this piece - I think that, when writing music for an RPG, the generic battle should be the one that gets stuck in the players' heads and keeps it somewhat light. Your boss themes are only going to be heard once so they can afford to be experimental, but the generic battle theme has to land as much as possible!"},
    {"id": 13, "name": "Heart of Steel", "year": "2018", "description": "A remix of 'Cult Grunt Battle'. I think this is one of the first songs I wrote that I felt really good overall about - it's catchy and has a lot of personality, I especially love that organ solo halfway in."},
    {"id": 14, "name": "Jingle (1)", "year": "2019", "description": "An assignment for college to compose a short jingle. This piece is very light and airy, using mostly synthesized instruments."},
    {"id": 15, "name": "Jingle (2)", "year": "2018", "description": "Composed for the same assignment as 'Jingle (1)'. This piece captures the same tone, but favours sampled instruments over synths for a softer texture."},
    {"id": 16, "name": "Love Ablaze", "year": "2018", "description": "A remix of 'The Trees Have Eyes' as a boss theme. The overall structure and composition is quite similar, but the textural changes completely change the mood: you aren't walking through dangerous terrain anymore - you're fighting it off. One of my favourite things when composing is seeing how much I can get out of a few musical ideas, and I think that this song works as a great example."},
    {"id": 17, "name": "Midboss", "year": "2020", "description": "A somewhat generic midboss theme for Dustworld - there are some sections rearranged from this in 'Gatewatcher', though they serve very different purposes. More intense than an enemy but more relaxed than a boss - midbosses bridge a really important gap, and making sure that their music does the same is very important to me."},
    {"id": 18, "name": "Minutia", "year": "2019", "description": "This was composed as part of an exercise where I pretended I had been hired to compose a title theme for 'The Binding of Isaac'. Thinking about how I would personally interpret the themes and tone of the game, while trying not to be influenced by any existing compositions, was difficult but very enjoyable. I would thoroughly recommend this exercise to anyone suffering from musicians' block!"},
    {"id": 19, "name": "Mummy King", "year": "2019", "description": "I think harmonic minors are easily some of my favourite keys to write in - they're just so satisfyingly edgy. This was a boss theme for some kind of desert king, written for the previously mentioned fictional fantasy game. I really love 'desert' music conceptually - it's one of those fun tropes where you can just immediately picture a style in your head, like 'snow level', 'ghost house', or 'evil clown'."},
    {"id": 20, "name": "Nephropalace", "year": "2020", "description": "This song is a favourite of mine - it's carefully constructed to build a mysterious, awe-inspiring atmosphere. The focus on woodwinds and a drum pattern that sounds almost like it's slipping over itself make the song feel menacing, though not aggressive, with the bass and staccato chords keeping it from sounding too reserved. The (7*3)+9/8 time signature prevents the listener from gathering their bearings, and wraps the entire piece together nicely. A cool theme, fitting for an ice dungeon!"},
    {"id": 21, "name": "Night of ClownTown", "year": "2020", "description": "<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/605515059019382784/614963596732006400/noid_default_dance.gif\" alt=\"A gif of the Noid doing the Fortnite Default Dance.\" style=\"width: 100%\"></img>honk honk :)))"},
    {"id": 22, "name": "Oboemomentum", "year": "2020", "description": "This piece is a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kikibubbs/\" target=\"_blank\" data-pause-music=\"false\">commission I wrote</a> of a Pokémon-style battle theme. I didn't particularly emulate any specific Pokémon composer but rather the general structure and mood of the series' music, though my style in general is very inspired by the fantastic Go Ichinose. Also, I was told to limit it to just instruments you could hold in your hands and a piano - but that didn't stop me from sneaking a synth in there!"},
    {"id": 23, "name": "Piratez", "year": "2019", "description": "I wrote this for an assignment in college - the restriction was to only use string instruments. I think it ended up sounding pleasantly swashbuckling."},
    {"id": 24, "name": "Scholar", "year": "2019", "description": "An encounter theme with a very enjoyable sense of energy to it - very evidently inspired by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG77HTdreh0\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Pit's theme</a> from Kid Icarus: Uprising. The clicky-clacky percussion isn't something I normally do, but it's always fun to make interesting rhythms out of. I don't know why I decided to try Ska-inspired chords, but it works in the song's advantage."},
    {"id": 25, "name": "Sewing", "year": "2020", "description": "This song is kind of insane, it swaps super arbitrarily between a bunch of different keys, tempos, and time signatures. I had a lot of fun writing it - especially those crazy semiquaver runs in the 9/8 and 13/8 segments."},
    {"id": 26, "name": "She Who Knows The End", "year": "2019", "description": "Another retake on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/reddeh-3c/climatic-showdown-updated\" target=\"_blank\">'Climatic Battle'</a>, as well as a remix of 'Scholar'. I feel like perhaps I should get another Climatic Battle reimagining in before 2020 is over, it's a pretty fun streak to keep up. Anyway, the percussion from Scholar is joined by some actual drums here, and the overall instrumentation is a bit more energetic and stressful. Besides that, though, the actual composition is very similar, aside from a few runs and a chromatic section at the end."},
    {"id": 27, "name": "Singularity", "year": "2019", "description": "A remix of 'Time Cruncher', for the fictional fantasy game I bring up a couple times here. The general idea is that there'd be a subplot about some kind of time wizard, and after you beat the king the wizard's powers begin to become unstable. This song is kinda meant to evoke the question of what happens if you're stuck in a time loop? Are you aware of it, at least enough to question what..."},
    {"id": 28, "name": "Space Eulogy", "year": "2019", "description": "Written for the same assignment as 'Ambient Cutscene', it samples a bunch of number stations and applies various effects to them. It's all very otherworldly and unsettling. I enjoy how evocative noises that are close to human speech but not quite can be."},
    {"id": 29, "name": "Synth Song", "year": "2019", "description": "I wrote this all using synth patches I made in the ES1 for my sound design unit in college. It's got a little bit of a spaghetti western vibe to it, especially with the twangy chords in the chorus and the whistles near the end."},
    {"id": 30, "name": "Theme of Clown", "year": "2020", "description": "A Dustworld battle theme I wrote for a reoccuring clown character, intentionally limiting myself to an hour and a half of time spent working."},
    {"id": 31, "name": "The Trees Have Eyes", "year": "2018", "description": "A dramatic dungeon theme - the marching snare rhythm really gives it an extra dramatic edge. Invoking existing emotional responses in people, like the inherent fear of seeing a large group of people march like clockwork, can work as a fun shortcut to get an intended mood across quickly."},
    {"id": 32, "name": "THOTEP", "year": "2020", "description": "In early 2020 I was in a really big phase of listening to a lot of James Roach and I think this song really showcases that. The hip-hop inspired percussion with big horn fills is a real indicator. Overall, I really enjoy how much personality this piece has."},
    {"id": 32, "name": "Time Cruncher", "year": "2019", "description": "...what happens if you're stuck in a time loop? Are you aware of it, at least enough to question what happens if you're stuck in a time loop? Are you aware of it, at least enough to question what happens if you're stuck in a time loop? Are you aware of it, at least enough to question what..."},
    {"id": 33, "name": "Tomb", "year": "2019", "description": "More hypothetical fantasy game music. The repeating organ really helps ground the piece - it's repetitive, but so are the bricks inside an ancient tomb! That was my logic behind it, anyway, I hope that the composition does enough to break the monotony up. Also, note the use of a motif from 'Mummy King' towards the end, tying together both two narrative and musical concepts - worldbuilding through music!"},
    {"id": 34, "name": "Underwater", "year": "2020", "description": "A simple 9/8 loop I made for an underwater city management game I'd quite like to make in the near future. My favourite part's definitely got to be the percussion: it's very reserved but doesn't sound sad, which fits the concept pretty well in my opinion."}
